                <h3>About Minmin</h3>
                <p>We adopted her 2 years ago when she was only 6 weeks old. Her mom gave birth to her
                    along with 4 of her siblings. We had been wanting a cat for a while and when I saw someone posted
                    that they are giving kittens away our desired came to fruition. Some of my
                    family members didn't want her at first, but they started liking and petting her after we got her. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>She is a black and white cat; we wish we knew her breed. What makes her physically different than
                    other cats is her symmetric bow on the nose. She is small but don't underestimate her power. She 
                    can be feisty if you try to bother her or make her do something she doesn't feel 
                    like doing. She scratches us sometimes, but we love her.
                </p>

            <p>Below is a picture of hers. Enjoy seeing a beautiful face.</p>
